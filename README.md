# ML_V1
ML analysis of V1
The goal of this porject is to use modern machine learning techniques to accurately predict neuron spike train outputs in V1 given some set of input information.

### Rationale
Recently, making generative models based solely on pre-trained deep convolutional neural nets are capable of inferring complex structures about the images and how we percieve them.
In some cases even, these pretrained image feature extractions (sometimes called annotations) once trained, have been able to exceed state of the art in some computer vision domains (e.g. [Deep Gaze II](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01563) using VGG)
